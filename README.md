setup-computer
--------------

##Description
A simple script to setup my computer.

##How To Run
Use "git clone https://github.com/jplace/setup-computer.git" to get a copy of the script.

Run "./setup-computer".

##Notes
- The resources folder contains anything the bash script needs to copy or reference while executing.
- You'll need to configure new SSH keys for use with GitHub, remote servers, etc. . I recommend following [GitHub's Guide](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-an-ssh-key/).
- I have enjoyed installing [drefile](https://github.com/luke0x/drefile) before -- you might think about installing it.
